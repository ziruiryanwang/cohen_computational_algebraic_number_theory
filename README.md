This is an implementation of chapter 1 (Fundamental Number-Theoretic Algorithms), 2 (Algorithms for Linear Algebra and Lattices), 3 (Algorithms on Polynomials), and 7 (Introduction to Elliptic Curves) from Cohen’s *A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory* in Rust for self-learning. It includes many important algorithms in number theory and crypto. The other parts are either heavily algebraic number theoretic or somewhat outdated (like the parts on primality testing and factoring), so I didn't implement them.
